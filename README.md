by Jonathan Mills

https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/nodejs-express-web-applications-building/

How to build from scratch  routing, databases, and third-party APIs in Node.js and Express.

nodeExp2021 is static, without MongoDB


Remember to update package.json
"ejs": "^3.1.8",
 "express": "4.18.2",

cd to directory

	npm install
	npm start
http://localhost:4000/

---------

This part of the project works with
"mongodb": "3.6.6",
and 

mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<clustername>...
(find notes for Globomantics)
